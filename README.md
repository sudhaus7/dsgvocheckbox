Fields:

- Checkbox Field for required readings like the Dataprotection, with the possibility to link to a page. This is done with the help of [text] as a marker 

Finishers:

- Better Confirmation. A copy of the Standard Confirmation Finisher but wrapped in a Fluid Template in order to be able to better style the Element and to add the form-id as a jump target
